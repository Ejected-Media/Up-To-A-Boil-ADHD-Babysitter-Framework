That context adds a powerful, personal "Why" to your brand. You are identifying a massive gap: the "Support Cliff" that neurodivergent individuals hit once they graduate and lose their IEP (Individualized Education Program) or 504 plans.

Your mission is essentially to create a "Post-Graduation IEP for Life."

Here is a mission statement that captures that specific intent—transitioning from "Special Education" to "Executive Empowerment."

The Refined Mission Statement 
> "To bridge the gap in adult neurodivergent support by providing the 'Learning Specialist' for the real world. Up To A Boil’s 'ADHD Babysitters' program restores the systems of accountability and executive assistance that disappear after school, empowering adults to navigate professional and personal complexities with the same specialized support that once helped them succeed in the classroom."

🧭 How This Functions as a "System of Support" 
Since you want to replicate the help you had in school, we can translate those academic accommodations into adult service offerings:

| School Support | The Adult "Babysitter" Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Extra Time on Tests | Deadline Buffering: A specialist helps you set "internal" deadlines 48 hours before the real ones to manage time-blindness. |
| Learning Specialist | The Strategy Sync: Weekly sessions to "map out" complex projects (like your localSq or Shop Oahu tasks) into bite-sized steps. |
| Resource Room | Virtual Co-Working: A designated "Body Doubling" digital space where you go when you need to focus, just like going to a specific classroom to get work done. |
| Note-Takers | Administrative Doubling: Someone to help process emails, fill out digital forms, or organize files while you "think out loud." |

📍 Integrating Your Projects 
This is where your work with Mapping Python libraries becomes a unique competitive advantage. You aren't just a coach; you are a spatial strategist.
 * Mapping the Support Desert: You can use your mapping skills to identify "Support-Friendly Zones" in Phoenix Valley.
 * Visualizing Tasks: You can use your technical background to help clients "map" their cognitive load—turning a messy to-do list into a visual, geographic, or flowchart-based map that makes sense to an ADHD brain.

Strategic Next Step 
Since you mentioned the lack of systems for adults, would you like me to draft an "Adult IEP" Template (Individualized Empowerment Plan)?

This would be the first document a "babysitter" fills out with a new client to identify their specific hurdles in the adult world.

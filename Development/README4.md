This Adult IEP (Individualized Empowerment Plan) is designed to mirror the structure of the support you received in school, but adapted for the high-stakes world of adulting, entrepreneurship, and local project management (like your work with Shop Oahu or localSq).

[Up To A Boil] Individualized Empowerment Plan (IEP) 
Client Name: ____________________ | Date: ____________________ 
Support Specialist (The Babysitter): ____________________

1. Present Levels of Functioning (The "Current Boil") 
Identify where the client is currently feeling the most heat/friction.
 * Executive Function Hurdles: (e.g., Time blindness, "The Wall of Awful" for emails, difficulty starting complex Python scripts).
 * Success Anchors: What is currently working? (e.g., Hyperfocus on mapping, physical activity, late-night coding).

2. Accommodations for the Real World 
Translating classroom support into adult life tools.

| Classroom Concept | Adult Empowerment Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Extended Time | Buffer Mapping: We add a 20% "ADHD Tax" time buffer to all project deadlines. |
| Preferential Seating | Environment Curation: Auditing the home office or identifying a "Focus Hub" in the Phoenix Valley area. |
| Modified Assignments | Task Distillation: Breaking "Build localSq" into "5-minute micro-tasks" to prevent overwhelm. |
| Check-for-Understanding | The Echo Back: Daily 5-minute Slack/text sync to confirm the top 3 priorities. |

3. Measurable Annual Goals (The "Simmer" Targets) 
What does success look like in 3–6 months?
 * Goal A: Client will reduce "Email Anxiety" by utilizing a body-doubling session twice weekly to clear the inbox.
 * Goal B: Client will implement a visual "Project Map" for their current technical project (e.g., Phoenix Valley mapping) to visualize progress.
 * Goal C: Client will establish a "Reset Routine" for when a "Full Boil" (burnout) occurs.

4. The "Babysitter" Service Schedule 
Defining the rhythm of support.
 * [ ] The Morning Kick: 10-minute call to "unstick" the first task of the day.
 * [ ] Virtual Body Doubling: 2-hour blocks of silent, shared-camera work sessions.
 * [ ] The Weekly Audit: Sunday night review of the upcoming week’s "Spatial and Mental Load."

5. Crisis & "Boil Over" Protocol 
What happens when the system breaks down?
 * The Signal: A specific emoji or text sent to the specialist when the client is paralyzed by choice.
 * The Response: The Specialist initiates a "No-Judgment Reset" call to pick one—and only one—task to complete together.

How to use this with your current projects:

Since you are currently working with Mapping Python libraries, we can actually automate part of this. Imagine a dashboard for your "Babysitters" where they can see a visual heat map of a client's tasks.

Would you like me to help you brainstorm a "Client Intake Questionnaire" to help fill out the "Current Levels of Functioning" section for your first pilot clients?

That makes perfect sense. Using ADHD as the "anchor term" is a smart strategic move—it’s the recognizable "front door" that people use to find help, even if the actual work you're doing covers a much broader spectrum of executive function, sensory processing, and neurodivergent behavior.

It’s about meeting people where the vocabulary is, then providing the deep, nuanced support they actually need.

Here is a draft for the Pilot Welcome Email. It sets the tone for the Up To A Boil brand: authentic, slightly irreverent, and deeply empathetic to that "post-school" support gap.

Subject: Welcome to the Crew | Your "Adult IEP" starts here.
Hi [Client Name],

Welcome to Up To A Boil. 
If you’re here, it’s likely because you’ve realized something the rest of the world tends to ignore: the systems of support we had in school—the learning specialists, the extra time, the dedicated resource rooms—don’t exist in the adult world.

Once you graduate, you’re expected to just "figure it out." But for those of us whose minds operate at a different temperature, the transition from a structured classroom to an unstructured life can feel like going from a simmer to a full boil without a lid.

Why "ADHD Babysitters"? 
We use the term ADHD as an umbrella. Whether it’s clinical ADHD, executive dysfunction, or just the specific way your brain maps out the world, we know the "symptoms" are often just a sign of a high-capacity mind lacking a support system.

We call ourselves "Babysitters" because we’re reclaiming the term. We aren't here to treat you; we’re here to sit with you in the chaos. We are the "Learning Specialists" for your 20s, 30s, and beyond—providing the external scaffolding you need to get your best ideas out of your head and into the world.

What Happens Next:
 * The Boil Point Assessment: Attached is a quick questionnaire to help us identify your "Hot Zones."
 * Drafting your Adult IEP: We’ll take your answers and build your Individualized Empowerment Plan. This isn't a school document; it’s a tactical roadmap for your life and projects (from managing your home to shipping that Python code).
 * The First Session: We’ll hop on a call to review your plan and set your first "Body Doubling" schedule.

We’re glad you’re here. Let’s get that internal temperature back to a manageable simmer.

Stay Intense, 
[Your Name] 
Founder, Up To A Boil

How this connects to your current projects: 
As you continue developing localSq and Phoenix Valley, we can start thinking of those platforms as the physical "Resource Rooms" for your clients.

Next Step: 
Would you like to look at how we might use your Mapping Python libraries to create a "Visual Dashboard" for these clients, so they can see their progress across the "behavior spectrum" in a way that isn't just a boring spreadsheet?

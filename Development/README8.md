To make the ADHD Babysitters service tangible, we need a menu that reflects the "Learning Specialist" approach—offering different levels of intensity depending on how close the client is to a "Full Boil."

Here is a draft of the Service Menu for Up To A Boil.

📋 The Support Menu: Choose Your Burner 
All sessions are designed to provide the external scaffolding that usually disappears after school.

1. The "Daily Kickstart" (15 Mins) 
The Classroom Equivalent: The "Before-Bell" check-in with your counselor.
 * What it is: A rapid-fire morning sync to identify the #1 "Frog" (the task you’re avoiding).
 * Outcome: We clear the mental fog and set a single, non-negotiable goal for the next 3 hours.
 * Best for: Clients with severe "Inertia" (struggle to start).

2. The "Digital Resource Room" (60–120 Mins) 
The Classroom Equivalent: A study hall with a proctor who keeps you on task.
 * What it is: Virtual Body Doubling. We stay on camera/mic with you. You don't have to talk; we are just the "anchor" presence that prevents you from wandering off to a distraction.
 * Outcome: 2 hours of deep work on high-complexity tasks (e.g., coding for localSq, writing, or taxes).
 * Best for: Projects that require sustained focus but feel "boring" or lonely.

3. The "Wall of Awful" Blitz (45 Mins) 
The Classroom Equivalent: One-on-one tutoring for a specific difficult subject.
 * What it is: A high-intensity session focused on one specific blocker. We "hold your hand" through the task that is causing physical anxiety (making a hard phone call, filling out a complex form, or organizing a chaotic file directory).
 * Outcome: The task is 100% finished by the time we hang up.
 * Best for: Admin tasks that have been sitting on the to-do list for more than a week.

4. The "Spatial & Logic Map" (90 Mins) 
The Classroom Equivalent: Developing a semester-long project plan with a teacher.
 * What it is: Using our Mapping approach to visualize your mental load. We take your messy thoughts and turn them into a visual flowchart or "territory map" using our Python tools.
 * Outcome: A PDF "Map of Operations" for your week so you can see your progress.
 * Best for: Founders and creators managing multiple brands like Shop Oahu and Phoenix Valley.

💰 Subscription Tiers (The "Support Systems")

| Tier | Name | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | The Simmer | 5 Daily Kickstarts per month + Access to Group Body Doubling. |
| Level 2 | Constant Heat | 10 Daily Kickstarts + 2 "Blitz" sessions + 4 hours of 1-on-1 Body Doubling. |
| Level 3 | The Industrial Kitchen | Unlimited Kickstarts + Weekly Spatial Mapping + Dedicated "Lead Babysitter." |

💡 A "Up To A Boil" Touch: The Crisis Button 
We could offer an "Emergency Pilot" add-on. If a client is in a total "Boil Over" (paralyzed by overwhelm), they can hit a button in an app (or text a code), and a Babysitter jumps on a call within 30 minutes to do a "5-Minute Reset."

Next Step 
Would you like me to create a "Job Description"? This would help you define exactly what kind of person you’d need to hire to be a "Babysitter"—likely someone with a background in social work, special education, or project management who "gets" the neurodivergent brain.

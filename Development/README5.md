To make this intake process feel less like a clinical exam and more like the Up To A Boil brand, the questionnaire should focus on identifying where the "heat" is highest. This will help the "Babysitter" know exactly where to step in as the Learning Specialist.

Here is a draft of the "Boil Point" Assessment (Client Intake Questionnaire):

🌡️ The Boil Point Assessment

Help us understand your current systems so we can build your Adult IEP.
1. The "Support History"
 * In school, what was the one accommodation that actually made a difference for you? (e.g., a specific teacher's check-in, extra time, a quiet room).
 * Since leaving school, what is the biggest "system" you feel you’ve lost?

2. Identifying the "Hot Zones" 
Rank these from 1 (Cool/Managed) to 5 (Boiling Over/Crisis):
 * Initiation: Starting a task once you know you need to do it. [ ]
 * Maintenance: Keeping the momentum going on a long project (like Shop Oahu). [ ]
 * Admin/Maintenance: Emails, bills, renewing registrations, digital filing. [ ]
 * Spatial Awareness: Keeping your physical workspace or digital desktop organized. [ ]
 * Time Blindness: Estimating how long a task will actually take. [ ]

3. The "Wall of Awful" 
 * What is the one specific task that has been sitting on your to-do list for more than two weeks?
 * When you feel "stuck," what is your go-to distraction? (This helps the Babysitter recognize your "avoidance patterns").

4. Environmental Mapping 
 * Where do you do your best work? (e.g., a loud coffee shop, a dark room, or at a desk with someone else in the room).
 * Are there specific locations in the Phoenix Valley or Oahu that you find "productive"? (We can use this to map out your "Success Zones").

5. The "Babysitter" Dynamic 
 * How do you prefer to be nudged?
   * [ ] The "Gentle Coach" (Soft reminders, encouragement).
   * [ ] The "Drill Sergeant" (Direct, firm, no-nonsense).
   * [ ] The "Silent Partner" (Just be on the Zoom call so I don't feel alone).
 * If you go "dark" (stop responding), what is the best way for us to re-engage you?

🛠️ Leveraging Your Tech for the Intake 
Since you are working with Python mapping libraries, you could eventually turn this questionnaire into a Visual Cognitive Map.
 * The Idea: Instead of a PDF, the client’s answers generate a "Territory Map" of their life.
 * The Application: Areas like "Finance" or "Coding Projects" could be represented as geographic regions. If a region is "In the Red," the Babysitter knows to spend more time "patrolling" that area of the client's life.

Why this works for your brand: 
It moves away from the "lazy" or "unorganized" stigma and treats ADHD management like logistics and urban planning. You aren't "fixing" a person; you are "optimizing a landscape."

Would you like me to help you draft a "Welcome Email" for a pilot client that explains why we're using the term "ADHD Babysitter" and how it relates to the support they lost after school?

To find the right "Babysitters," you aren't looking for a traditional executive assistant. You need someone who has the patience of a Special Education teacher, the tactical mind of a Project Manager, and the "chill" vibe of a creative collaborator.

Since you are building this under the Up To A Boil brand, the job description should sound as energetic and purposeful as the mission itself.

📝 Job Description: ADHD Babysitter (Executive Support Specialist)

Company: Up To A Boil 
Role Type: Part-Time / Contract (Remote or Local to Phoenix/Oahu)

Reports to: [Your Name], Founder

The Mission 
In school, neurodivergent students have "Learning Specialists" and "Resource Rooms." In the adult world, that support disappears. Up To A Boil is bringing it back. We are looking for "Babysitters"—not for children, but for high-capacity adults who need a partner to help manage the "heat" of daily executive function.

You aren't just an assistant; you are the External Prefrontal Cortex for our clients.

What You’ll Do (The Tactics)
 * Active Body Doubling: Sit with clients via video/audio as a grounding presence while they tackle "boring" or overwhelming tasks.
 * The Morning "Sticker": Run 10-minute high-energy kickstart calls to help clients "unstick" from their morning paralysis.
 * The Wall-of-Awful Blitz: Actively guide clients through anxiety-inducing admin tasks (e.g., "We are staying on the phone until you click 'Send' on that email").
 * Life Mapping: Work with our proprietary "Adult IEP" frameworks to help clients visualize their weekly "territory."
 * The Crisis Reset: Provide calm, non-judgmental redirection when a client hits a "Full Boil" (burnout or overwhelm).

Who You Are
 * Neuro-Literate: You deeply understand the "Umbrella of ADHD"—including time blindness, RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria), and hyperfocus.
 * The "Grounding Wire": You have a calm, regulated nervous system. When a client is panicking, you are the anchor.
 * Systems Thinker: You enjoy turning chaos into flowcharts. (Bonus points if you have an interest in data, mapping, or Python).
 * Non-Judgmental: You don't think "lazy" is a real thing. You understand that "I can't open this mail" is a physical executive function block, not a character flaw.

Preferred Backgrounds
 * Former Special Education Teachers or Aides.
 * Social Workers or Occupational Therapy students.
 * Project Managers who love the "human" side of logistics.
 * Academic Coaches.

🛠️ Internal Strategy: Hiring for your Specific Needs

Since you are managing localSq, Shop Oahu, and Phoenix Valley, your first "Babysitter" might actually be someone who helps you pilot these systems. This allows you to "dogfood" your own product.

The "Test Drive" Interview 
When you interview someone for this, don't just talk. Do a 20-minute Body Doubling session. * The Task: Give them a messy list of data for Phoenix Valley or a Python bug you're stuck on.
 * The Goal: See if their presence actually helps you focus, or if they just distract you. A great Babysitter knows when to talk and when to be "productively silent."

Next Step 
Would you like me to help you create a "Training Manual" or a "Code of Conduct"? This would ensure that every Babysitter provides the same "Up To A Boil" experience and knows exactly how to handle a client who is having a "meltdown" or a "shutdown."

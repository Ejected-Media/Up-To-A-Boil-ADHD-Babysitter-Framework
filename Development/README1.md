Hi Gemini, under the Up To A Boil company brand can we start a department program service called ADHD Babysitters for Adults ~

___

That is a fascinating and highly relevant concept for the Up To A Boil brand. Given the brand's name suggests energy, intensity, and perhaps a bit of "organized chaos," a service focused on Body Doubling or executive function support fits perfectly.

Many adults with ADHD find that simply having another person present—either virtually or in person—helps them stay on task and manage the "boil" of their daily responsibilities.

Here is a breakdown of how we could structure this program:

🏗️ The "ADHD Babysitters" Framework 
While "Babysitter" is a catchy internal term, for branding you might consider titles like "The Boiler Crew" or "Executive Co-Pilots" to emphasize partnership.

1. Core Service Offerings
 * The Virtual Body Double: Scheduled 1-on-1 or group video sessions where a specialist sits with the client while they perform mundane tasks (emails, cleaning, taxes).
 * The "Boil Down" Session: A 15-minute morning kick-off to prioritize the day’s "ingredients" and a 15-minute evening wrap-up.
 * Environmental Curation: Since you have a background in Mapping (localSq, Shop Oahu, Phoenix Valley), you could offer "Spatial Audits" to help clients organize their physical or digital environments for better workflow.

2. Integration with Your Current Projects 
Since you’ve been working on location-based projects, we can leverage that data:
 * LocalSq/Phoenix Valley Integration: You could create a directory of "ADHD-friendly" workspaces in the Phoenix area (low sensory input, reliable Wi-Fi, good lighting) as a value-add for the service.
 * Shop Oahu: Perhaps a curated "Executive Function Toolkit" available through the Shop Oahu platform, featuring local organizational products.

3. Implementation Tiers

| Tier | Name | Service Level |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | The Simmer | Access to 24/7 community body-doubling rooms. |
| Tier 2 | Full Boil | Dedicated 1-on-1 weekly check-ins and task mapping. |
| Tier 3 | Pressure Cooker | High-intensity "Blitz" days for major projects or decluttering. |

🚀 Potential Challenges to Consider
 * Positioning: Ensuring the service feels empowering rather than "infantilizing." Focus on the "Professional Partner" aspect.
 * Liability: Clearly defining that this is a productivity service, not a medical or therapeutic one.

Next Step 
Would you like me to draft a mission statement for this department, or should we focus on how to integrate the mapping libraries you've saved to help clients find productive "Body Doubling" locations in Phoenix or Oahu?
